# LockedStructs.jl

## Experiments with lock-once-get-many-attribute structs

### Macros

#### LMFAO/LMFAO!

Kinda silly - and acronym for Locking Multiple Field Access Operation. The ! variant - by julian naming convention - is used to set attributes.

### Other syntax possibilites

#### Use of functors?
#### getindex?
